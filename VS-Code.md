## Features ##
1. Emmet Abbreviations
These useful shortcuts come built-in to VS Code, and they make writing HTML (and CSS) a lot faster.

2. The Integrated CLI (Command Line Interface)
To save switching between windows, VS Code offers an integrated terminal or CLI. Simply, press CNTRL + ' or CMD + ' to open it up, and the same command to close it. It will automatically open in the directory you have open in VS Code, which saves the navigation step required for operations in a standard terminal.
This makes it easy to install NPM or Yarn dependencies, commit files to Git, and push files to Github — as well as anything else you might want to do via the command line!

3. ESLint
ESLint is a powerful and popular linting tool, which helps you spot errors in your code and fix them as you write and which helps you follow common best-practices. It’s also a great learning tool, since researching ESLint errors has taught me many best practices I didn’t know before, and it’s helped me understand why they are best practices.

5. Multi-Cursor Shortcuts
The ability to edit with multiple cursors can be a huge time saver. To use this most effectively requires memorisation of a handful of commands, but they’ll soon become second nature.

## plugins ##
1. Quokka
Quokka is a debugging tool that gives live feedback on the code you are writing. It shows you previews of the results of functions and calculated values for variables. The extension is easy to configure and works out of the box with JSX or TypeScript projects.

2. Faker
Quickly insert placeholder data using the popular Faker JavaScript library. You can generate random names, addresses, images, phone numbers, or just paragraphs of classic Lorem Ipsum. Each category has various subcategories so you can make the data fit your needs.

3. CSS Peek
WIth this extension you can trace the definitions of CSS classes and ids in your stylesheets. When you right click on a selector in your HTML files, choosing the options Go to Definition and Peek definition will send you to the CSS code in which you've styled them.

4. HTML Boilerplate
The HTML boilerplate extension will save you from having to manually write the head and body tags of a new HTML document. Just type html in an empty file, hit the Tab key, and a clean document structure will be generated.

Small plugin that gives you various information about the colors you've used in your CSS. By hovering on a color you can see a larger preview of how it looks, as well as info about its translation to all formats (hex, rgb, hsl, and cmyk).

6. SVG Viewer
This extension adds a number of utilities for working with SVGs in Visual Studio Code. It makes it possible to render SVG files and see how they look like without having to leave the editor. There are also options for converting to PNG and generating data URI schemes.

7. TODO Highlight
This tool marks all TODO comments in your code, making it easier to track down any unfinished business before pushing to production. By default it looks for TODO and FIXME keywords but you can add your custom expressions as well.


8. Regex Previewer
Useful tool for live testing your regular expressions. It works by applying the regex pattern over any text file opened to the side, highlighting all the matches. Kinda like RegExr but right inside your editor!
